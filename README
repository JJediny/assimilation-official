For reasons unclear to me, Cmake likes to put lots of full pathnames into its files.
I would hope it would be sufficient to say cmake before making things and it should go from there.

However, failing that, try removing files named like these:
	CMakeCache.txt
	cmake_install.cmake
	Makefile
	CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake
	CMakeOutput.log
	Makefile2
	TargetDirectories.txt

The only files I created are named *.c *.h, README, CMakeLists.txt, Doxyfile and *oui.txt
	(the latter of which aren't really used)
