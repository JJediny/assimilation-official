This code builds with cmake, not the autofoo tools...
There are currently two test modules that you can run after building it.  They are:
	python tests/alltests.py
	cd testcode; sh ./grind.sh	# Assumes you have valgrind installed.

If you want to build the documentation, you can just say "make doc".  If you just want
to view the latest version online, go to http://assimmon.org/

For reasons unclear to me, Cmake likes to put lots of full pathnames into its files.
I would hope it would be sufficient to say cmake before making things and it should go from there.

However, failing that, try removing files named like these:
	CMakeCache.txt
	cmake_install.cmake
	Makefile
	CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake
	CMakeOutput.log
	Makefile2
	TargetDirectories.txt
