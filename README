/** @page README Assimilation README file
Welcome to the Assimilation README file :-D.

This code builds with cmake, not the autofoo tools...
You can a formatted version of this README online at
http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/_r_e_a_d_m_e.html


@section Dependencies
We like to have a reasonable number of things in the build environment.
- Cmake - http://cmake.org/
- C compiler (gcc, clang, or MS VC tools) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/ <i>et al</i>
- make tools - like Gnu make, or MSVC - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ <i>et al</i>
- Recent version of Glib2 - http://developer.gnome.org/glib/
- libpcap (or winpcap) - http://www.tcpdump.org/
- pkg-config (even for Windows) - http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
- valgrind - The 'C' level tests use it - http://valgrind.org/
- Testify - testing framework from Yelp - https://github.com/Yelp/Testify
- doxygen (for documentation) - http://doxygen.org/
- dot (for doxygen graphs) - http://www.graphviz.org/
- Ctypesgen is good to have around http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/

@section MakingIt Making The Assimilation Monitoring System from Source
If you know how to use cmake, you probably already know what to do.

@subsection MakingItForLinux Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for *NIX Systems
If not, you can follow these instructions for *NIX type systems.
- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- make

@subsection MakingItForWindows Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for Windows
- Ask Roger :-D

@section TestingIt Running our Tests
There are currently two test modules that you can run after building it.  They can be run
like this:
- cd tests; python ./alltests.py # Listens for LLDP or CDP packets
- cd testcode; sh ./grind.sh	# Assumes you have valgrind installed.

Note that the "grind.sh" test assumes you have LLDP or CDP packets visible to the
machine it's running on.  Probably ought to fix that.

@section OtherTargets Other Make Targets
- doc - makes the documentation If you just want to view the latest version online,
go to http://assimmon.org/

For reasons unclear to me, Cmake likes to put lots of full pathnames into its files.
I would hope it would be sufficient to say cmake before making things and it should go from there.

However, failing that, try removing files named like these:
- CMakeCache.txt
- cmake_install.cmake
- Makefile
- CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake
- CMakeOutput.log
- Makefile2
- TargetDirectories.txt
