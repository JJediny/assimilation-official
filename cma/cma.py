#
#	Design outline:
#
#	All incoming network messages come in and get sent to a client who is a dispatcher.
#
#	The dispatcher looks at the message type and computes which queue to send the
#	message to based on the message type and contents.
#
#		For death notices, the dispatcher forwards the message to the worker
#		assigned to the switch the system is on - if known, or the worker
#		assigned to the subnet.
#
#	Each worker handles one or more rings - probably handling the per-switch rings
#	for a subnet and the subnet ring as well.  It is important to ensure that a ring
#	is handled by only one worker.  This eliminates locking concerns.  When a given
#	worker receives a death notice for a drone that is also in higher-level rings,
#	it does its at its level and also forwards the request to the worker handling
#	the higher level ring as well.  The first subnet worker will also handle the work
#	for the top-level (global) ring.
#
#	Packets are ACKed by workers after all work has been completed.  In the case of
#	a drone on multiple rings, it is only ACKed after both rings have been fully
#	repaired.
#
#	The reason for this is that until it is fully repaired, the system might crash
#	before completing its work.  Retransmission timeouts will need to be set
#	accordingly...
#
#	Although congestion is normally very unlikely, this is not true for full
#	datacenter powerons - where it is reasonably likely - depending on how
#	quickly one can power on the servers and not pop circuit breakers or
#	damage UPSes
#		(it would be good to know how fast hosts can come up worst case).
#
#
#	Misc Workers with well-known-names

#
#
#	Mappings:
#
#	Drone-related information-------------------------
#	NetAddr-to-drone-name
#	drone-name to NetAddr
#	(drone-name,ifname) to interface-info (including switch info)
#	drone-neighbor-info:
#		drone-name-to-neighbor-info (drone-name, NetAddr, ring-name)
#
#	Ring-related information--------------------------
#	drone-name to ring-name(s)
#	ring-names to ring-information (level, #members, etc)
#	ring-links-info	??
#	Subnet-to-ring-name
#	Switch-to-ring-name
#	Global-ring-name [TheOneRing]
#
#	Discovery-related information---------------------
#	(drone-name, Interface-name) to LLDP/CDP packet
#	(drone-name, discovery-type) to JSON info
#
#
#	Misc Info-----------------------------------------
#	NetAddr(MAC)-to-NetAddr(IP)
#
#
#	Dispatcher logic:
#	For now sends all requests to TheOneRing because we don't have
#	a database yet ;-)
#
#	We will need a database RealSoonNow :-D.
